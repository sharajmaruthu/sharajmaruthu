## 🏁 Fun Fact
I'm faster than an F1 pit crew — at replying, debugging, and sometimes even panicking under pressure. 😉

---

## ❤️ Things I Love
- Clean UI & clean code (both give peace of mind)
- Dark mode everything 🌑  
- F1 race weekends — I *breathe* Formula 1  
- Lewis Hamilton. Always has been. ** 7 x🏆🐐**  
- That one commit that fixes everything  
- Late-night coding with music and silence

---

## ❌ Things I Hate
- Merge conflicts (nightmare fuel)  
- JavaScript errors that say "undefined" and then *disappear*  
- Slow internet during `npm install`  
- When LeetCode says "Wrong Answer" and you're 100% sure it’s right  
- **Team Java in my college — no offense, but I’m built different 😏**
